# Objective
Create and deploy a ready to use AI-powered agent for a commerce website. Reference: ~[https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-rufus](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-rufus)~
# Features
General conversation with agent
For example: "What's your name?", "What can you do?"
Text-Based Product Recommendation
For example: "Recommend me a t-shirt for sports."
Image-Based Product Search
Product recommendation and search are limited to items in a predefined catalog.
<aside> 
Note that we're looking for a single agent that handles all 3 use cases, rather than separate agents for each function.
